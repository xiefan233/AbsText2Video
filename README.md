The download link contains more than 510,000 video clips. We generated abstract text annotations for the first 100,000 video clips, which can be downloaded from the “Collected” folder in this repository.

In addition, we also generated abstract text annotations for 100,000 video clips from the WebVid dataset, which can be downloaded from the “Webvid” folder in this repository.
